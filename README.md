# Leaderboard App

## Questions from the challenge

- What are your ideas on how to store the state in the backend?

With api calls to send the new participant and to receive the information about the current state of the race in real time. I believe a socket connection would be ideal to get this information in real time.

- How would you transfer the state changes between frontend and backend?

With api calls or with a socket connection if we need real time updates.

- Are there steps you were unable to finish?

I wasn't able to finish the active and leaderboard.

- Suggest 3 additional steps/features to add

1 - Add the active board
2 - Add the leaderboard
3 - Add the participant functionality

- How did you use AI to help you in the process?
  A: I started to try copilot some months ago. I only used it to make things a bit faster. Sometimes I ask gemini some stuff, but the old good google search is still better in most cases.
